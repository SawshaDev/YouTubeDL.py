## IDE and Other TOOLS
If you want to be a contributer or are just starting out as being one, i recommend using these tools/IDES to work with us

+ VSCODE or PYCHARM as you **IDE**, The reason behind this is that they all share similar workflow and are easier for everyone to use overall.
+ git bash or the desktop github app as **Version Control**. Both of these are easy to use and learn.
